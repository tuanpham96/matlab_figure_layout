# FigLay MATLAB
### *Figure layout planning in `Inkscape` & `MATLAB` for easily-reproducible figures*  
This function is for planning figure layout in Inkscape (to produce tagged `.svg` files) before plotting sub panels in `MATLAB`.   
The reason I wrote this function was because of the manual labor of deciding the subplot positions in `MATLAB`.  
The idea of using `Inkscape` to create a tagged `.svg` file is from the package in `python` called `FigureFirst`. Specifically, the github link is https://github.com/FlyRanch/figurefirst.
